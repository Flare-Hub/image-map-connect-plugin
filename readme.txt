== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=What is an image map?=

Image map is an image with clickable areas that can be used e.g. to navigate to different pages of the same website.


=Can I add an image map to an archive page?=

Yes. In a block theme, you can include the image map in the archive template. If you embed it in the query loop block, only markers for the posts in the archive will be displayed on the image map.

In a classic theme, you can add it to the widget area. Any widgets on an archive page will automatically only show markers for the posts in the archive.


=Can I make the image map style compatible with my theme?=

Yes. The image map size, borders and background color are configurable. The popup text styling is taken from your theme by default and you can further modify the style to align with your theme.
